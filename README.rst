Data reduction workflow
-----------------------

  The workflow is as follows.
  The word "script" is used to denote a distict step in processing the data rather than actual script.

  1. Start with a nexus file. As in, ``/HFIR/HB2B/IPTS-22731/nexus/HB2B_439.nxs.h5``
  2. This is read in by something that will split into sub-scans and create a project file [script 1 - currently convert_nexus_to_hidra.py]
  3. This is read in by something that will create powder patterns and add them to the project file [script 2 - currently reduce_HB2B.py]
  4. This is read in by the gui to do the peak fitting and add the results to the project file [script 3 - currently somewhere in the gui]
  5. This is read in by the gui and used to create the summary .csv file [script 4 - currently being written]

  Some other things to note
  * scripts 1-2 will be refactored/combined to create a new reduce_HB2B.py that can be run by autoreduction
  * scripts 2-4 (more like functionality 2-4) will all live in the gui in some way
  * going back any number of steps will delete the following steps from the project file. This is to prevent users from having a project file with powder patterns that are not associated with the peak fitting from the project file.


Developer Quick Start
-----------------------

If you've never used PyRS before, you can get started quickly by doing the following.

1. Install basic dependencies: Pixi, Python, and PyQt. Pixi installation requires linux.
2. Create a new Pixi environment with additional dependencies:

Installation using a Pixi environment
------------------------------------------
Pixi environments are only supported on OSx (x86) and Linux using python 3.11

1. Configure Pixi environment:

.. code-block::

  pixi install

2. Run PyRs with Pixi:

.. code-block::

  pixi run pyrs

Running and developing PyRS
---------------------------

To start main window from analysis machine

.. code-block::

  pixi run pyrs

To develop

To run all of the tests

.. code-block::

  pixi run test

Running specific tests can be done `through standard ways`
<https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/usage.html>`_. For example

.. code-block::

   pixi run python -m pytest tests/unit

will only run the unit tests
