## Mantid ecosystem moved to Python 3.12 across all channels (2026-07)

As of early July 2026, every Mantid conda channel used by this project —
`mantid/label/main`, `mantid/label/nightly`, `mantid-ornl/label/main`,
`mantid-ornl/label/rc`, and `mantid-ornl/label/nightly` — only publishes
Mantid 6.16.x builds linked against Python 3.12 (`py312`). Older 6.15.x
builds (Python 3.11) have been pruned from these channels' repodata; they
no longer resolve even though their version numbers still satisfy a
`>=6.15.0` constraint.

**Symptom:** `pixi update` (or `pixi install`) fails to solve any
environment that depends on `mantidworkbench`/`mantid`/`mantidqt`, with
errors like:
- `mantidworkbench >=6.15.0,<6.16.0 cannot be installed ... is excluded
  because candidate not in requested channel` — the upper-bound pin
  excludes the only builds left in the channel.
- A large `pyqt` vs `mantidqt`/`mantidworkbench` conflict tree ending in
  `python 3.12.13, which conflicts with the versions reported above` —
  caused by the base (unconstrained) `pyqt = "*"` dependency in
  `[tool.pixi.dependencies]` / `[tool.pixi.package.run-dependencies]`
  pulling in PyQt5, while `mantidqt` now requires PyQt6. This wasn't a
  true "no py312 build" problem (PyQt5 5.15.9 has a `py312` build); it's
  redundant PyQt5 that isn't needed once Mantid supplies PyQt6 via
  `mantidqt`.

**Fix applied** (see [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml)):
1. Bump `requires-python` to `>=3.12` (project-wide).
2. Drop the `<6.16.0` upper bound on `mantidworkbench` in the base
   dependencies and in the `qa`/`prod` feature dependencies — only
   `>=6.15.0` is needed now.
3. Remove the bare `pyqt = "*"` dependency from
   `[tool.pixi.dependencies]` and `[tool.pixi.package.run-dependencies]`.
   `qtpy` is kept (binding-agnostic); Mantid's own `mantidqt` dependency
   now supplies PyQt6.

After these changes, `pixi update` solves cleanly for all four
environments (`default`, `dev`, `prod`, `qa`), and
`pixi run -e <env> test-import-framework` (imports `pyrs`, `qtpy`,
`mantidqt`) passes in each.

**Why this matters going forward:** if `pixi update`/`pixi install`
starts failing again with a `pyqt`/`mantidqt`/`python_abi` conflict tree,
check whether Mantid has moved to a newer Python ABI first — the fix is
usually to relax an upper-bound version pin, not to add new pins.
